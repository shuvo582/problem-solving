I'll help you understand and derive the algorithm for finding the modulo of very large numbers. This is an important problem in computer science, especially in cryptography where we often need to work with numbers too large to fit in standard data types.

Let's derive it step by step:

1) First, let's understand why we need a special algorithm:
   When numbers are very large (let's say hundreds of digits), we can't directly compute n mod m because:
   - The number n might be too large to store in memory
   - Direct division would be inefficient

2) Let's derive the algorithm using a key property of modular arithmetic:
   For any numbers a and b:
   $$(a + b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$$

3) Using this property, we can break down a large number into its digits:
   For example, let's say n = 6789
   We can write it as: 6789 = 6000 + 700 + 80 + 9
   Or more formally: 6789 = 6×1000 + 7×100 + 8×10 + 9×1

4) In general, for a number with digits d₁d₂d₃...dₙ:
   $$n = d₁×10^{n-1} + d₂×10^{n-2} + ... + d_{n-1}×10^1 + d_n×10^0$$

5) Using the property from step 2:
   $$n \bmod m = (d₁×10^{n-1} + d₂×10^{n-2} + ... + d_n) \bmod m$$
   $$= ((d₁×10^{n-1} \bmod m) + (d₂×10^{n-2} \bmod m) + ... + (d_n \bmod m)) \bmod m$$

6) This leads us to the algorithm! Let me write it in Python:

```python
def large_number_modulo(number_str, m):
    result = 0
    power = 1
    
    # Process each digit from right to left
    for digit in reversed(number_str):
        # Convert char to int
        d = int(digit)
        
        # Update result: (previous_result + digit * 10^power) mod m
        result = (result + (d * power) % m) % m
        
        # Update power of 10 for next iteration
        power = (power * 10) % m
    
    return result
```

The key insights that make this algorithm efficient are:

1) We never need to store the full large number - we process it digit by digit
2) We use the property $$(a \times b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) \times (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$$
3) At each step, we keep the intermediate results small by taking the modulo

Let's verify with an example:

The algorithm correctly calculated that 123456789123456789 mod 97 = 7, and we verified it using JavaScript's BigInt!

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of digits in the input number. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store a constant amount of variables regardless of input size.

This algorithm is particularly useful in:
1) Cryptography, where we often need to compute modulo with very large numbers
2) Hash functions that use modulo operations
3) Problems involving large numbers in competitive programming

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or show you how it works with different numbers?
